Sometimes we try to drown our existential angst with drugs, party and worldy/materialistic things to run away from the truth. That makes us a kafir. It is a state of mind.

Women who cannot produce these many witnesses often end up in jail themselves for adultery ‚Äì a crime against the state mostly punishable by stoning to death. Under such a caricature system, rape victims have less reason to accuse anyone as a rapist. So in states where this vague law of requiring 4 witnesses is still applicable, the issue pertaining to the production of four witnesses arises when a woman who is the victim of rape accuses some specific person or men raping her. In that case, there are only two ways an Islamic court of that relevant country can convict the rapist(s): The accused rapist confesses to his heinous crime; or She produces four witnesses to justify her claim that so and so person raped her.

Muhammed (PBUH) was taken to one of these when he was 4 btw. You learn domestic labor, physical labor, etc. Basically if you compare a 13 yo back to one rn they would be on average more intelligent than women today. Not to mention society is very flawed currently, especially teaching women about their menses. Rn women are just figuring out how to take care of themselves properly and what it means to be a mature.

Covering up for women is definetly a hardship which men don't have to deal with. But i think what makes this equal is not ""men have to cover too or men have other hardships that balance it out"". I think what makes this equal is the fact that women have the chance to be rewarded for something which men dont have tje chance to be rewarded for. And you may argue that it comes with a consequence that men dont have to deal with. But so does everything else. People who have eyes will be asked what they gazed upon in their lifetime. People who are blind have to struggle, but they never deal with the consequences of sinning throug gaze and their struggles may reduce some sins even. The same goes for the difference of rich and poor or the difference of being born into a different country, a different community, in a different family, a different religion... the list goes on...

I would accept if someone says homosexuality is perverted because his religion says so. (Though I do not agree with this assertion.) (The red herring fallacy is a logical fallacy that occurs when someone presents irrelevant information to distract from the main issue or argument. The red herring is the piece of information that is used as a diversion. For example, if someone complains about their day and someone else says, ""You think that's bad? Try commuting for two hours in the pouring rain!"" . )",UCHDG6VaE2WaDk3476AEvzSg,http://www.youtube.com/@howardphung281,1,UgxPZEKIElfoSvCEmVN4AaABAg,@GOTkristin

So this verse answers the question if it is possible for Muslim men to marry female slaves. The verse before that made it also clear who Muslim men are allowed to marry.

Some people in turkey think following Arab Islam is the answer. Turkish Islam is based on the equality of men and women in Turkish culture which is why turkish Islam is based on things like respect and harmony. All terrorists for that reason all come from Arab countries where Islam has arisen from a society ans culture that was already deeply polarised unequal and unrefined in many ways. In other words, the culture of a people determines how you will interpret Islam as a society. Islam therefore amplifies the qualities that a culture / society already has. For example, islam would benefit the Germans a lot more than it benefits Arabs. In fact it would be better for Arabs to turn atheist first to be able to have a ‚Äûcultural reset‚Äú before turning back to Islam and finding a harmonious version of Islam that is not entrenched in cultural failures.

A man's voice can be attractive to women, so in the same vein why aren't men disallowed to do call to prayer to prevent women being distracted or led inappropriately by his attractive voice? My argument also applies to the differences in hijab. A woman's face and hair are open to being sexualised and tempt the man's gaze if uncovered. A man's face and hair can be attractive and tempt a woman's gaze too. Why is the man's gaze seen as something to protect but a woman's isn't? So whilst I agree that in many ways men and women are built differently, and I believe Islam promotes peace and equality between men and women, I don't agree that there is just explanation to making the differences in hijab so hard on women and disallowing call to prayer. I recognise that it can allow benefit for those who want to wear it, like how it was said for intellect to be met before beauty, but I don't see why this shouldn't apply to both men and women. That a man's face can also be beautiful and therefore if he wishes to cover it for his protection from the woman's gaze and to be appreciate his intellect and other strengths first. A man's gaze to me has no more power than a woman's. And to Kafir for raising so many points on the inequality present in allowing female slaves and explaining them so calmly without pressing his thoughts on other contenders or putting words in others' mouths. I didn't like how Jad treated Atia's arguments, saying ""if you're saying this, you must be saying this."" X or Y, no in between - this was not giving her room to explain her own statements, instead concluding it for her, not recognising that his conclusions were his interpretations and not the absolute truth, and yet expecting others to respect his statements and arguments. This discussion became unbalanced in power dynamics and unpleasant to continue watching.

There are also alot of challenges when having multiple wives, such is in fair in treatment and etc. Hence why some muslims prefer to have 1 wife so they wouldn't face repercussions of their actions, in the day of judgement if they ever was even a single strand of unfair treatment between the wives.

The reason why incest isn't generally accepted in society is because it's between people who are closely related and -- in most cases -- will have known each other for most/all of their lives. There's almost always a power dynamic that's being abused there. However, two consenting same sex adults who aren't related don't have those complications. But all that notwithstanding, it makes little sense as an argument, because if it's OK to use incest as an example of why homosexuality is wrong, then it's just as valid to argue that heterosexuality is wrong because a brother and sister might then think it's OK to have sex with each other. It's a strawman argument, usually peddled by people who struggle to articulate why they think homosexuality is wrong by only sticking to the subject of homosexuality. For example, I'm in a same sex partnership and my partner and I definitely aren't related. Therefore, you can't really use incest as a reason why our relationship is ""wrong"" because we're not related. So then you have to think of something else. What will it be?

However, once we talk incest - which can be totally arranged in such a way that it takes out all power dynamics, offspring, etc. - the religious argument still explains why it's prohibited. However, the liberal ideology is now stuck with a victimless intimate relation that is completely consentual which fulfills the criteria of ""two consenting adults"", however it is still considered morally reprehensible, and thus, a no-go.

The taboo against incest, even in unaware circumstances, is rooted in the universal need (universal ethics) to maintain clear family structures and prevent potential genetic risks, which are concerns transcending cultural boundaries. 2. In contrast, the moral stance against homosexuality in some societies is often based on religious or cultural beliefs rather than a universal ethical principle or a biological imperative. From an ethical standpoint, the key difference lies in the inherent nature of the act: incest, even unknowingly, can disrupt fundamental family and social structures, while consensual homosexuality, when free from societal prejudice, does not inherently cause such disruption or harm. From an anthropological and sociological positions, Incest even consensual, ruptures the fabric of current civilisation structure. 1. In agricultural societies (which current civilisation today is structured from), lineage and inheritance are crucial and incest disrupts the clear demarcation of familial roles and relationships. 2. This could lead to confusion in lineage, property rights, and social order, which are foundational for the stability of these societies. 3. This disruption is likely why incest is a taboo across various cultures, serving as a protective measure to maintain societal structure and coherence.

Here is a simple example. When you go on a bridge you have faith that it will not collapse. This is because you have faith in civil society to create rule of law and regulations to which educated and competent people will maintain the bridge, and that no one will bother with trying to destroy the bridge. Ultimately the bridge is not guarenteed to never fall. That bridge can always be blown up by terrorists. The natual environment could always unleash something never seen before and take out the bridge. That framework that enables you to have faith in a bridge not falling down is the same framework that is imposed by a religion, but instead of thinking of the external objective world, the religion refer to the conscious projection in consciousness or what is known as the ""creation"". If you think of religion and religious texts as describing objective reality you are mistaken. Religion should be thought of socio-psychological, ie: Religion should be thought how a collection of consciousness behave in a society and how that is feedback into itself. When thought of in that sense, of course it could make sense to tell the uneducated to not bother questioning because it is ultimately futile. It is impossible to understand the chaos and those who think they understand tend to be humbled by their arrogance. I mean why will the bridge not fall? Why why why? Do you know all the engineering? Do you know all the science? Do you know what the weather will be? Do you know what the economic conditions will be?

Let me share a story. Imagine inheriting a huge sum of money. Many might think of buying a house, traveling, or maybe starting a business. But Fatima al-Fihri, a Muslim woman back in 859 CE, had a different idea. With her inheritance, she built a mosque in Fez, Morocco. This wasn't just any mosque; it grew to become the University of Al-Qarawiyyin ‚Äì recognized by many as the world's oldest continuously operating university! Now, why would she invest in education if Islam discouraged questioning or learning? The university became a beacon for scholars from various fields, from medicine to astronomy. It was a hub of critical thinking, debate, and, above all, knowledge-seeking. Speaking of knowledge, the Quran, Islam's holy book, repeatedly urges believers to reflect, ponder, and learn. There's even a verse that says, ""Read in the name of your Lord who created."" Reading, reflecting, and asking questions are all foundational to Islamic teachings. And if you journey back in time to the Islamic Golden Age, you'll find scholars like Ibn Sina writing medical texts, Al-Khwarizmi laying the foundations of algebra, and Ibn al-Haytham pioneering modern optics. This era was like the Silicon Valley of its time, bustling with innovation and discovery, all rooted in a culture that cherished knowledge. In a nutshell, Islam doesn't just tolerate questioning and learning; it celebrates it. And history, with its universities and scholars, is a testament to that.",UCqaWa0mqcINjRba2Xi53Lng,http://www.youtube.com/@SHABLABADOOPS,1,Ugw9hyZZJEm8QtS8UpZ4AaABAg,@MissesSniffles

You could make the argument that it‚Äôs some type of codependent relationship and it stems from a lack of social interaction with others, potentially a coping mechanism for poor parenting or trauma (ala flowers in the attic). But once again, this isn‚Äôt reason enough as the argument against gay people is often down to poor parenting/trauma. 2. Estranged siblings - if they never know it could never hurt them. If they bring kids in they should be advised against it. If they don‚Äôt bring kids in then I really have no comment on their relationship. 3. Mental health disorders - topic has been discussed frequently in other sites but I don‚Äôt think those who can‚Äôt consent should be able to have children. It‚Äôs ‚Äúdouble SA‚Äù.

Meaning women would not be able to call for prayer everyday. Also in the Quran, women were mentioned more than men. Men are supposed to treat women with up most respect and treat them like queens, and it frustrates me how so many men forget about that and continue to treat women disgustingly.

There are no wars going on anymore. Secondly, Islam didn't start slavery, it was deeply engrained throughout the world along with many other evils. Islam came to set rules, guidelines, and restrictions to improve the treatment of those slaves, eventually leading to their freedom. Islam was extremely progressive in that it gave slaves rights, it gave them a voice to complain to authority, it also gave them many means to be freed. ""Slavery"" after Islam during the time of our prophet was nothing like slavery how you would think about it today (like the slavery of black people in america). In Islam, freeing slaves is rewarding and an act of charity, and the compensation of many sins is to free a slave. Freeing slaves was HIGHLY encouraged. In one narration, our Prophet told men that if they are too poor to marry a woman (due to the mahr/wedding gift), they can marry a slave woman and give her freedom as the wedding gift. Also, it is forbidden to ""rape"" or harm your concubine in any way and physical relationship has to he consensual. If I was there on the jubilee set I could speak more about this but to give clarity, Islam came to improve the treatment and system of war prisoners at the time, not to allow slavery, because that was already being practiced at the time. Back in the day if muslim men didn't take the people in as ""slaves"", those people would have been greatly mistreated due to the norms back then!

The demand for servile labor during this period was fueled by wealthy residents of the port city of Basra, who had acquired extensive marshlands in the surrounding region. These lands had been abandoned as a result of peasant migration and repeated flooding over time, but they could be converted back into cultivatable status through intensive labor."" ""Both the working and living conditions of the Zanj were considered to be extremely miserable. The menial labor they were engaged in was difficult and the slaves appear to have been poorly treated by their masters.

I understand that achieving impartiality can be challenging for various reasons, but regrettably, this particular conversation proved to be rather ineffective for a few key reasons: 1. To be an Ex-Muslim, the person would have went through a very strong spiritual battle/influence and therefor will have strong feelings and their own understanding to justify their stance - prime example is obviously with Kafir 2. Among the four Muslims involved in the discussion, it's apparent that at least two of them are relatively new to Islam, either as reverts or converts. This isn't to undermine their intellect but to emphasize that they may not possess the same level of vocalization or knowledge to provide valuable insights to the Ex-Muslims and, particularly, to the viewers. 3. This comes to my 3rd point which while I get it Jad was most vocal from the Muslim side, he needed to be because of Point 2. Which is why fair representation of both knowledge and attached-feelings are necessary to take account. Regrettably, this also led to Jad being singled out, both by the Ex-Muslims, Atia, and even the mediator, especially concerning the topic of homosexuality. In my opinion, a more impartial Middle Ground session could have been achieved by either organizing a discussion between Reverts and Ex-Muslims or a session featuring a Convert versus a Non-Muslim. This could provide viewers with a better understanding of the perspectives involved, ultimately delivering more rewarding content.",UCOKymywcHZvo5SRx089WnxA,http://www.youtube.com/@RahimMushfiq,0,,

There is a significant chance of a incestous relationship being a manipulative relationship where the other party is sort of coerced into the relationship. For example children can't consent to a relationship with an adult because they don't have the intellect to realize the situation and the authority of the adult, which makes the situation manipulative. So, is the incestuous relationship truly consented to? It is far more likely than non-incest relationship to be so. Comparing incest and homosexuality doesn't make sense in the first place because incest exists in every form of sexuality, but homosexuality exists apart from it. The argument assumes that there is something inherently wrong with homosexuality, which we can't point to, so we have to make a irrational connection with incest.",UCPdrltZfXRA32ZMUhgVXKiA,http://www.youtube.com/@archoaxu,1,UgzJLhwB5X-FMYL4GKh4AaABAg,@archoaxu
