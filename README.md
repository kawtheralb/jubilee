# jubilee

In this project, I explore how I can treat a set of YouTube videos as a quasi-experiment, exposing participants (i.e., YouTube commenters) to four "stimuli" (including a control) conditions.
Using the YouTube channel, [Jubilee]([url](https://www.youtube.com/@jubilee)), as an example, I selected four videos (three from the ["Middle Ground"]([url](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBVNJo7nhINSjBZdNezW15PzOTCc-10m9)) playlist).
