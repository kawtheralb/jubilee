But then people use the guidance to not watch R-rated movies - which is totally up to the individual's choice - as the same type of restriction and used to classify the Church as a cult. We can go through the entire list that way.

XD Declaring something as 'a social construct' only contributes to this discussion if one erroneously believes social constructs can be inherently ignored or dismissed. Under the broadest definition literally everything is 'a social construct' (which is usually what is employed when the term is used), but that doesn't mean that these things matter less. Family could be called 'a social construct', as could money, yet I'd argue you only dismiss these out of hand when it fits a tribal line, rather than trying to argue with your boss that 'showing up on time is a social construct', because he would just argue that 'you getting paid is a social construct' - yet neither of these 'observations' change the reality that one needs to show up on time in order to get paid. ""The innate drive is to have sex, not to have children."" Yes, just as ""we don't have a drive to not starve, just a drive to eat and drink"". If one is going to split hairs to this degree, there's no point in having a conversation - the link from 'food to not starving' is the same link from 'sex and procreation' - they are literal cause and effects. ""It took thousands of years for our ancestors to figure out the cause and effect between sex and childbirth."" Bull. Show me anywhere in recorded history where this claim could be verified. Because otherwise it is just some 'intellectual' speculation, and if ancient mankind couldn't determine basic cause and effect, they could not have survived let alone domesticated animals etc.",UCInVP9_cwRICJI53cr08JFQ,http://www.youtube.com/@OntheOtherHandVideos,1,Ugynltx6yWwq3b4HkBJ4AaABAg,@worldoffaeriehelpers9154

When there‚Äôs actually 50% women in a group doing 50% of the talking, men (especially Mormon men) perceive the women as taking up MAJORITY of the space and time. So it makes sense for the panel to reflect that. I think Cardon is comfortable speaking and acting the way he does in this video because he‚Äôs used to being the ‚Äúauthority‚Äù, the ‚Äúleader‚Äù, ‚Äúpresiding over‚Äù meetings, basically automatically taking charge in ANY group of people that doesn‚Äôt include men that are higher-up in the church authority structure. The entitlement is unbridled, he feels comfortable inserting himself and centering himself in any and all conversations. Do I think that Cardon addresses the women as ‚Äúgirls‚Äù to INTENTIONALLY intimidate them? No, I don‚Äôt think he was necessarily super conscious of it. But it shows the implicit bias of the culture he‚Äôs coming from.

Basically he was trying to say that everyone has something that challenges their faith. Tember had struggles living in a gay culture that encouraged him to be promiscuous, especially when his religious beliefs conflicted with that social pressure. Ultimately found that it was more fulfilling to live a faithful lifestyle with his loving wife and kids, and has made peace with that part of himself. Meanwhile, Cardon‚Äôs leukemia has been a significant trial for his faith and outlook on life, whereas his sexuality has never been a source of strife. He‚Äôs saying that he would much rather experience the hardships that Tember went through if it meant he would live an extra 20 years. The point is that the church isn‚Äôt oppressive to homosexuals, nor is there anything wrong with same sex attraction. There are just certain facts of life that get in the way of the life you want to live, especially when it comes to faith, and that‚Äôs true of everyone regardless of what form those trials take.",UCBByDmMGcPqTNLGFANwMwcQ,http://www.youtube.com/@KnuttyEntertainment,1,UgwGgdi7GS7ZPQp8HrR4AaABAg,@beccajustine2233

They're trying to have it both ways and it doesn't make theological sense.

The Church has us arguing about semantics they made up to excuse themselves for changes they were forced to make. The reason that doesn't pass the smell test is that the church is SO reluctant to define things as doctrine or policy UNTIL they want to change something. And on that day ""it was policy all along, promise!"" The argument that ""other churches do it too"" = also ridiculous and fallacious. You would think that the ""one true Church"" would be a leader in progressive changes and civil rights movements rather than always showing up late to the table (e.g., race issues, polygamy). The Church responds when its forced, it doesn't lead. They do what they must to maintain tax status and to avoid hemoraging members as they catch up to society. But it seems that if they could, they'd really prefer that we never had to change these policies. The gender stuff--UGH. ""Separate but equal"" lines are bogus; I thought we all knew that now. Equality would mean women are everywhere men are. It would mean there are roughly 50% of women in meetings saying roughly 50% of the words and making 50% of the decisions. And BTW this gender discrimination cuts both ways. Equality would ALSO mean that men were allowed to stay home and women were allowed to work without murmurs in the hallway. It would mean that we didn't limit and define groups by their average differences and instead view people as they are and celebrate their potential and interests.

There‚Äôs a number that come from very black and white thinking/rigid families or local communities and/or struggle to hold flexibility in their views. These are the ones I see being reacted to the most from the ex-lds communities. These are also the ones I least relate to. I don't fit into this experience of the church on so many different levels. The frustrating thing about the ‚Äúcult‚Äù trope is that it flattens an LDS experience to just this one subsection of our faith community. It gets tiered as THE view and experiences like mine are dismissed, ignored, or minimized. My faith community is by no means perfect.
