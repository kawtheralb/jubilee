Think of Oli based permanent paint. And brushes. People are brushes. And paint is Christianity. People who accept Christ as their savior are brushes who decided that they needed to jump in the permanent paint. They are forever change. And an atheist is a paint brush who not only refuses to go in the paint, but also refuses to admit that paint exists, and also that they were literally created for paint, to glorify paint, and to spread paint worldwide. Until oneday the atheist (paintbrush) decides that their life is completely meaningless and that they see other brushes spreading paint and how much paint has changed the brushes(Christians) and how much paint changes everything it touches and colors the entire world. So then the atheist takes the risk and jumps in the paint and never goes back to being a paintless paint brush ever again because they can‚Äôt. Once it‚Äôs done it‚Äôs done. The brush is changed forever. There is no such thing as a ex-Christian. Just like a how a painted brush can not be unpainted again. But there is such thing as an ex-atheist.

Body dysmorphia is a mental condition where a person worries abt their perceived flaws and appearance, it messes with your perception of your own body and can cause you to have a warped perception on your body. It isn‚Äôt frowned upon in my experience (I‚Äôm sorry if it‚Äôs been yours, it should always be treated with understanding) but you‚Äôre discouraged from doing anything to your body as your perception is warped. For me, for example, I thought I was a lot larger than I actually was and was actually underweight for a time. Body dysmorphia is often accompanied by eating disorders but that isn‚Äôt always the case. Gender dysphoria is a sense of unease or dissatisfaction with one‚Äôs biological gender as it doesn‚Äôt match with their gender identity. You hear of this most often with trans ppl as it results in them transitioning. They aren‚Äôt recommended surgery, that‚Äôs often a choice they make on their own and often therapy comes before or after transitioning bc gender dysphoria often causes severe depression and suicidal ideation. After starting hormones, transitioning, or surgery if chosen, it‚Äôs reported that these mental health issues decrease (I can link a study I found if you want). It helps improve their mental health, encouraging someone with body dysmorphia and telling/letting them ‚Äúdo something about it‚Äù leads to more harm oftentimes. To their mental wellbeing and to their body. This was long but I hope this helps you understand a little more. Please do more research on it or listen to ppl who have gone through it. If there are any trans ppl who have more to add or would like to correct me please do so.",UCTpsx7tydTwjzIlS1nO81CA,http://www.youtube.com/@laiainautumn-1252,1,Ugz3O-R2GRQNiLPdzyV4AaABAg,@aaroncrilly2005

As for wearing mixed fibers, there is mountains of nuance here. This is not so much a moral law as it is a social law given specifically to the Israelite people. First, the ""mixed"" fibers referred to were wool and linen. Only the priests could wear such mixtures (which also shows that the mixture, in and of itself, is not sinful). Therefore, the social law is making clear that there is a distinction to be made, just as we have laws today that say you can't where officer clothing and impersonate a military/police officer. There is much more to be said here, but I won't go too deep because I will assume you don't care much about this nuance. (Feel free to correct me of that assumption.) So the next natural question is, how do we distinguish between social prescriptions and moral absolutes? Common sense, really. Paul gives a great example of this. ""For it is written in the Law of Moses: 'Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.' (emphasis mine, 1 Cor. 9:9). An atheist would look at this and say, ""Ah, so have you muzzled an ox lately? See! You committed a sin."" But the law, like all laws, have a spirit to them. Paul uses this social prescription to show that it would be immoral not to support the church's teachers. This spirit-of-the-law point, speaking modernly now, is also why no one would convict a father rushing his wife and child to the ER, though he may have committed countless traffic violations. The spirit of the law, when it comes to traffic violations, is to protect life. Did the father honor the spirit of the law by rushing his wife to the ER? Yes. Again, what about homosexuality? There is nothing in the Bible that explains this as not a sin. There is nothing that homosexuality alludes to in the spirit of the law. And worse, the New Testament still makes clear that this was and still is objectively a sin.",UCPV2G6uERb4Z5EnzsI29TUw,http://www.youtube.com/@DookyButter,1,UgzjDmTOE0NIQ7ZQskV4AaABAg,@naomypalaciosnolasco7910

I believe that female circumcision is wrong; some women do not, even the women who have had it done believe it is correct. Americans will shout it's wrong from the rooftops, YET Americans practice male circumcisions every day. You could say Americans are more empathic in this regard, but that doesn't make it accurate.
